## Webstorm/Git and GitHub tutorial 

#### Step 1: *Download Webstorm*
  Link to download WebStorm was posted on Cnavas with instruction on how to downlaod it to your device. WebStorm is a development environment for JavaScript and other coding languages.

#### Step 2: *Download Git*
  The process of downloading Git was a bit more tricky than downloading WebStrom. Git is Source control system that you downlaod onto your laptop. It was not neccesarily harder to download, there were a few complications due to the fact that I downloaded it onto a Macbook while most students in the class used a Windows operating sytem. In order to download Git, I had to paste a link from Homebrew onto my devices terminal and download it from there. After this I typed git --version into the terminal to confirm that it was downloaded.

#### Step 3: *Make a GitHub account*
  This step was fairly easy as I only needed to use my school email to create an account on Github which is a website used for managing and storing code from Git.

#### Step 4: *Link WebStrom and Git*
  The final step was to link my already linked Git ad Githib accounts to Webstorm. This was also quite a difficult step due to the fact that I was one of the few Mac users in the class. In order to link Webstorm and Git I had to open Webstorm, click VCS in the top left corner of my screen and then "Share project on GitHub," which should be the last option. This then directs you towards the github website and finalises the last step of this process by linking your WebStorm and Github accounts. 

## Glosarry

- __Branch__ <br> A line of code that exists separate from the main line of code but is still connected. I understand this as a tree and its branches.
- __Clone__ <br> This is a command used to create a local copy of a repository.
- __Commit__ <br> Commit is almost used like a save button in a video game. After you have made progress in your code you can stop and save it, or “take a snapshot” so that when you need to start over you begin form the point where you committed the code.
- __Fetch__ A command that downloads committed code from a remote repository onto your local device. Like a dog fetching a bone. It does not affect the locally saved repository.
- __GIT__ <br> A source control system that turns folders on a computer into repositories.
- __Github__ <br> A hosting service used for managing Git and storing code.
- __Merge__ <br> This is a way of taking all the lines of code that have been branched out form the main code and putting them all together into a single branch (The main branch). 
- __Merge Conflict__ <br> These occur when the same line of code in a file has been edited and committed by two different people. 
- __Push__ <br> This is the action of uploading a local repository to a remote repository.
- __Pull__ Pull almost has the same funtion as Fetch however they are differne tand not to be confused. Pull fetches committed code from a remote repository to your local repository and changes the code in the local repo to match the newly fetched one.
- __Remote__ <br> A repository that is hosted on the internet rather than locally. 
- __Repository__ <br>  A central area where data and information on a project is stored and tracked along with all the changes made to the files.
